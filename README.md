# Spacewar (Level III)

This project will give you experience writing graphical applications. You will also learn how to use classes and 
object-oriented programming to streamline your code.

## What to do

Create your own version of [Spacewar](http://runpython.com/?user=BrythonServer&repo=Spacewar&name=spacewar.py) using
the images and sounds included in this repository.

Your game must include the following:

* A fixed star field background.
* At least one player.
* Either multiple playes, or some (in)animate object(s) to avoid.
* Animated rocket thrust for the ship sprites.
* Collisions destroy ships.
* Moving and rotating ships - physics realism at your discretion.

Optional elements that you may want to include:

* A score keeping system.
* Two or more players controlling multiple, different ships.
* Projectiles launched by user command.
* Track player lives.
* Realistic gravity.
* Animated explosions.
* Moving background.
* Scrollable or zoomable playing area.

You *may* use the original 
[Spacewar source code](https://github.com/BrythonServer/Spacewar/)
as a reference while working on this project, but please cite it as a resource if you do. As always,
you should understand any additional code that you borrow or include on this project.
